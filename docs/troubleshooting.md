### if your oneplus6 is not visible in adb after deleting userdata

- this can happen if you deleted userdata partition and not created new one
- this can't be fixed from twrp, only can be fixed from orangefox
- flash orangefox
- go to orangefox menu -> adb & sideload
- turn adb switch on and off on top of the screen
- swipe `swipe to start sideload` slider on the bottom of the screen
- press X on the left top corner of the screen
- try `adb devices` again
- another way to fix it is flash stock rom via edl
